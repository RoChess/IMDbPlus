#summary Helping scraper-script developers fix problems.

=Debugging scraper-scripts=

Movie database sites adjust their code, so the scraper-scripts have to be modified.

Sometimes this causes problems that prevent everything from working correct. The best way for a scraper-script developer to figure out what is going wrong is to look at the !MovingPictures log file set to scraper-script debug mode.

To enable scraper-script debug mode, use the following steps:

 * Open MovingPictures configuration, and go to the "Importer Settings" tab:

 * Adjust the radio button to "Manually Manage" the data source scrapers:

 * Then use the gear icon to select the following option:

This will activate the scraper-script debug mode, which you can verify via: http://blixy.net/mp/FAQ.MovingPictures.1f_Scraper.Debug.Enabled.png

*IMPORTANT:* So now that you turned on scraper-script debug mode, you have to make sure that the log file contains the problem you are trying to report. Keep in mind that this debug mode generates huge log files in the Megabytes for each movie. Everything also happens at the same time, so you want to be sure to only import or refresh a single movie.

After you are done, ZIP up the movingpictures.log file and attach it to a forum post (or Google Code Issue) that your scraper-script developer monitors.

To locate the movingpictures.log file; Start Menu -> 'All Programs' -> Team !MediaPortal -> '!MediaPortal' -> Use the shortcut 'User Files' -> navigate to the 'log' subfolder.

And remember to turn scraper-script debugging off after you are done, unless you do not have a problem with the giant log file and the delays it causes.
